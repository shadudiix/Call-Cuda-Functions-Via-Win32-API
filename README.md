# Call Cuda Functions Via Win32 API :bulb:

Is that even possible? 

to be honest, I thought it wasn't possible because I guess the toolkit a using Inline assembly

but after analysis, I found it's using a pre-compiled library, ( i guess it's developed in C/C++ ) and have an exported functions.

Like ntdll, kernel32.. etc

Research and analysis :mag::
=======

In the first, I wrote a very simple program and linked it to Cuda-Toolkit

it use "cudaDriverGetVersion" to get Driver cuda version Reference: [#](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART____VERSION.html)

A very simple program, and works without a problem..

and 11060 represent as 11.6 Cuda version for my graphic card in current time ( GTX 1650 )

But let's go to [ProcessHacker](https://github.com/processhacker) and see our program modules..

### NvAPI.dll, Nvcuda.dll

Nvcuda is our target, NvAPI had been explained before, and you could see it here as an example: [#](https://github.com/JeremyMain/NVAPIQuery-Windows-)

But Nvcuda, as an example, I never saw someone call cudaDriverGetVersion via [GetProcAddress](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress) before!

### Note

Nvcuda.dll Can be located in 2 Paths

1 - For x64 Process in: 

### %windir%\System32\nvcuda.dll

2 - For x86 Process in:

### %windir%\SysWOW64\nvcuda.dll

So let's analyze it in CFF Explorer to find the exported functions 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadudiix/Call-Cuda-Functions-Via-Win32-API/main/Pictures/4.png)

We found ( cuDriverGetVersion ), could we call it via [LoadLibrary](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya) and [GetProcAddress](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress) ? 

We'll do that in the next section.

### Note

Every device uses Nvidia graphics card..Nvcuda.dll is installed in System32 and SysWOW64 (for x64 Architecture), so no need to link to Cuda Toolkit :wink:


# Examples of functions :gear:: 

#### cudaDriverGetVersion: 

So after we found our function, I wrote a procedure for cudaDriverGetVersion to call it in Runtime, 

I just load the library via LoadLibrary ( Nvcuda.dll ) and Get the address of the function via GetProcAddress, Very Simple!

It's worked without a problem, and show the same result when I linked Cuda Toolkit..
